### How to use
1. Download the fwl.mjs module and import it in the file where you're going to write the document and bind it to global object
2. In case of node call fwl(global)
3. If you use a browser call fwl(window)
4. Set the document type to print
5. Call create method and inside braces use the functions you need to generate the code.
```javascript
import fwl from "./fwl.mjs";
fwl(global);
documentType = "bbcode"; //"markdown" "html"


```
This document is generated using node index.fwl.mjs, use it as an example/reference.

Example of a table:
